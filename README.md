Our project allows you to buy a ticket from a service we support, the web2 ticket will be tokenzed using our oraclizer, tokenized tickets can be exchanged or sold to other users without any risks of being scammed.
What makes this project special is the fact that there is little to none infrastucture changes needed for web2 to companies to transition to our solution.

Made during ETH Warsaw 2024 hackathon.
